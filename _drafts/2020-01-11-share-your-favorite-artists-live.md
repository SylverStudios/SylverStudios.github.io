I love Spotify. It captures a reflection of myself as I listen to different styles over time. Often my recent music taste can give a better summary of myself than I can. Conveniently, they also have a nice API that can make sharing that with your friends pretty easy too.

# Non-technical Appreciation / Release

What do I (4me) want from this article?

* Release a cool thing I've been working on.
* Share how much I enjoyed working with AWS SAM.
* Talk about the high level of how I did it
* Inspire others / inform them if others are already interested

## Inspiration

I listen to a lot of music, and I like to keep track of what I've been enjoying lately. I had a conversation with a friend this year where we ended up sharing playlists, and realizing that we both treated them as journal entries to some extent! The best way to share that time and experience with each other was to listen to the playlists on our own time and at our own pace.

After that experience I appreciated that my taste in music is a good sample of who I am at the moment, and my inner nerd started to kick in. I thought to myself, "I don't want to explain this to everyone to share what I'm into at the moment, can I do it digitally?" We have this website, Spotify has an API. I thought it might be as easy as getting a Spotify developers token and a lambda. It didn't end up __that__ easy,  but it was totally doable!
