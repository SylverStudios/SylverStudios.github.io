Sam "G.Q." Roberts was born and raised in the sleepy suburbs of Woodbridge, CT. He was a precocious young boy who excelled in many areas of his life, including Guitar Hero and World of Warcraft. One week, as a budding software engineering intern, Sam found himself with little work to do but lots of passion to create the best JavaScript game that the internet has ever seen. The product of his labors were the now famous [SuperVirus]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-02-16-supervirus.html %}). In online gaming communities, and in his dreams and fantasies, Sam goes by Sylverhandâ€”a moniker that our fans might find eerily familiar.

He now lives in Somerville, MA with his girlfriend and 17 cats.
