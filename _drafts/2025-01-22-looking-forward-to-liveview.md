LiveView and why I'm excited to move forward. [![LiveView logo]({{ "/assets/phoenix.jpeg" | relative_url }}){:class="excerpt-image"}](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/welcome.html)
<!-- Ends the excerpt text, it includes the image -->

This is a reflection on my love letter to Elm, to make myself better understand why I’m ready to move forward. I’ve been watching LiveView for a long time and it’s passed my threshold to look beyond Elm. It has become mature enough to depend on, easy to develop with, and a leader in showcasing the benefits of modern [SSR](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/server-side-rendering). As my goals grow and change, I need my toolkit to as well. I’m looking forward at more experimentation and exploration with LiveView as the medium. **LiveView’s simplicity and capability makes it the best tool for modern use cases and I’m stoked to see just how much there is to gain.**

I’m excited to push LiveView to explore it’s potential. The shift to SSR and a unified language for frontend and backend unlocks some incredible benefits. **By removing the separate frontend language and API layer, the [cognitive load](https://minds.md/zakirullin/cognitive) to develop a product is dramatically reduced.** This removes hundreds of lines of code I’ve come to accept in the past and simplifies the mental model of data flow. All of this is a result of a comfortable SSR language ([heex](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/components.html#heex)) and advancements in websockets, which make the client experience nearly indistinguishable from a traditional SPA. Seamless, real-time updates with server push elevate SSR to compete functionality-wise with modern JS-driven SPAs. Especially in the case of Elixir where process driven concurrency makes it so easy to take advantage of these benefits!

To be fair to Elm, I’m going to miss it and its unparalleled strengths. The truly unique degree of confidence provided by its error-proof runtime and compile-time checks made it a delight. **Elm excels in building complex UIs in API driven environments.** But for my next chapter, I’m focused on exploring new territory and delivering innovative products, where LiveView aligns perfectly with fast iterations over the stability I loved from Elm.

Every tool has its place, and **LiveView is the right choice for where I’m headed.** Elm is an excellent choice for many scenarios, but my joy comes from providing services that users love, and discovery requires iteration. I’m confident with LiveView I can reduce iteration time, yielding more cycles, faster feedback, and ultimately more progress in less time. I’m excited to see how far LiveView and I can go on this journey.
