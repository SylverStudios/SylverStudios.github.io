What do we want to talk about?

* Unity
* Art
* C#
* Deadlines


The game jam we joined had some simple rules. Start Friday. Build a game that is loosed based on the theme of "Spirits" in any interpretation that you want. Stop working on Sunday. This was the first time we've joined a challenge like this, so we decided to increase the difficulty by making it our first published game made in Unity. We aren't C# developers, but we have all tone a tutorial or two with Unity, making us confident we could assemble something playable.

We broke up into 3 roles for the most part; Aaron on art; Sam building the C# game logic; RJ tying everything together in Unity. We each learned a lot about our roles, and how different they are from some of the other games we made.

**The Unity built in collaboration tool was surprisingly great!** We are very accustomed to collaborating using Git at work and for personal projects, but we tried to Unity built in collaboration tool just to see how it was and we ended up sticking with it. There were a couple bumps along the way, but we highly recommend trying it out, and we are git CLI fanboys.

Annoyingly, we made a heavily menu based game that would have been easy for us in React, or Elm, but in Unity we were starting from scratch. After a good amount of fighting with C#, we did end up with a couple working pages, but I expect there is a much easier way to build what we were doing. C# isn't to blame for that, but I think the feeling was unanimous that we all enjoyed the languages that we write usually, but the support of Unity makes it completely worth it.



## Design
(break this up)
Art takes so much longer than you expect it to! We worked on the project for about 15 hours, and it's crazy how few assets came out of that. In retrospect, there is also so much more to the aesthetic of your game than just the few images of game pieces. The designer's role can encompass the entire feel of the game. With [The Ferryman](www.google.com) we had a lot of text, menus, and backgrounds. Choosing a color pallet and letting Sam and RJ get at it just wasn't enough to give the in-game Bar the feeling that we wanted. Next time around, I think the design role will be a more holistic job, focused on putting less effort into more aspects of the game, instead of lots of effort into a handful of assets.


## Timeline

This part was actually awesome for us. Historically, we have had very soft deadlines, if any at all. The deadline was non-negotiable and it was such a short window of time, we knew exactly how much effort we would be able to put in before losing our sanity. We prioritized ruthlessly, cutting out many "fun", but inessential features to the game. At the end of Saturday morning, we had a plan that would yield a playable game with the minimal features that we could still consider it a "game."

Of course this didn't lead to the worlds most exciting game, but that wasn't our goal. We wanted to challenge ourself to plan well, and execute. That has been a problem in the past for us, and this was the best opportunity we've had to really test out or self-control.

## So, what happened at the end?

On Sunday afternoon, we were wrapping up the game, trying build a WebGL version that we could publish on the website and send to the Jam and we realized we didn't read the rules very closelyâ€¦ An additional rule farther down the page said, "no text at all". Obviously that is a huge rule, and seeing as our game was basically all text, we couldn't submit it. Despite how disqualifying our mistake was, winning was never our goal. We were on a mission to challenge ourselves, and we absolutely crushed it.

At the end of the day, we loved the jam. Pushed ourselves to the very limit of our sanity and physical well being, learned an unearthly amount for a single weekend, and had a blast. To everyone out there that is thinking about making games. I was scared to do a game jam. We would go to meetups and conferences where everyone would suggest doing a game jam, constantly telling us how good it would be for our personal development and it took us years to finally get around to it. They were right. We certainly didn't need to wait as long as we did. The great part is that signing up takes like 2 minutes, so if you can overcome your fear for that long, we will be able to do it!
