RJ has always loved video games and computers. His first game console was the
Sega Genesis, with which he fell in love with the original
[Sonic the Hedgehog
games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog#Sega_Genesis_(1991%E2%80%931996)). He also loved simulation games such as
[Rollercoaster Tycoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon),
[SimCity 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_2000),
and [SimAnt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimAnt). In the early days of the
internet he relished in creating
[Cameron's World](https://www.cameronsworld.net/)-esque websites on
[Angelfire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelfire) and
[GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities), learning the
rudiments of HTML, CSS, and FTP along the way.
[Microsoft Frontpage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage) was his
jam, and crudely copy+pasted snippets from the page source of other websites
were his peanut butter. Do you remember fondly when websites would often have
custom cursors with trails, and falling snow and confetti animations? So does
he.


These days RJ is a software engineer who mostly writes Ruby, but is generally
interested in other languages, like Elixir and Elm. He has lots of opinions
about most things, including game design, and hopes to one day build an RPGTCG
like the
[Pok√©mon Trading Card Game for the Game Boy Color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Trading_Card_Game_(video_game)).
