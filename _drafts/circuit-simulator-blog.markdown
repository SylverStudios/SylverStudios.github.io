### Inspiration

Sam and Aaron picked it up in October of 2015. They had each worked on a few small games, and had planned ideas together, but this was the first parallel coding exercise. They decided to tackle this with the most vanilla JS that they could do, recently having learned that scoping a project properly will have a major impact. You can see the origins of these blossoming, young professional devs [in the CircuitGame Repo](https://github.com/SylverStudios/CircuitGame).

Aaron had always been excited about solving circuit diagrams in school and thought it would be a fun game to be interactive, versus pen and paper. Boy was he right! The first pass at circuit simulator was not only impossible, but it was completely devoid of fun. They called it a smashing success.

<!-- I think there needs to be a little section talking about what the game actually is -->

### Development

The development was the most exciting part of this project for the team. Much white boarding and coding on the couch together ensued. The really exciting part of developmentwas that each circuit was a Directed Acyclic Graph, which meant Sam and Aaron got to write some fun recursive functions. Also there was a backend model to generate and test a graph for success, this was Sam's domain. Whipped up with a passion that would frighten most adults, Sam produced a great generation engine. At the same time, Aaron was working on UI generation tool that could traverse the graphs that Sam produced and render a nice little interactive circuit diagram.

### Reception

Somewhere amidst all of this fun and excitement, it turns out the most people don't really like to solve circuit diagrams! Aaron was so enamored by the nice Paintbrush created logic gate icons, that he never realized that you the purpose of a game is to actually 'play' it, not just enjoy the crispness of the icons and interactions. At the end of the day, the boys had created a real franken-game. Existing somewhere between proud, embarassed, and bullishly ignorant, they decided to publish the game on our original site under the title Circuit Simulator. They realized it wasn't actually a game anymore, but the effort was in, and there was a feeling a accomplishment that spread throughout the Mansion despite the weird outcome.

In the end, you might not love simulating circuits on 1 of the 3 possible configurations that can be produced, but maybe you will enjoy the story or learn a lesson for your own development. [Simulate some Circuits boi!]({% post_url 2019-01-21-circuit-simulator %})
