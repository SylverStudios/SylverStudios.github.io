So glad you could join us on this holy day (also MLK day, double-dope). Why is it a holy day you ask? Because we are taking the next step towards being legit. We are consolidating some of the more disparate resources that we've published under the `SylerStudios` tag; vines(link?), blog posts(link?), and games(link?). We have also simplified some of the infrastructure, so :fingers-crossed: we will keep this site up to date and it will look pretty too!

We are still figuring out this `Jekyll` thing, but it's been pretty painless so far. As always, we love feedback, let us know what you think and we will keep being your favorite place for news & sports coverage.

(Insert feedback link here - google form? netlify form? just the email? Add disqus? Maybe we need to get visitors first, amirite?)
